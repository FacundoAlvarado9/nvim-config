## How it looks

Backup of my nvim config. This is how it currently looks:

If you like it, feel free to use any part of it. All plugins credit goes to the plugin authors

## Tutorial
This is a tutorial mostly for myself. Please keep in mind that <b>I am not proficient at all in nvim config</b>. Any comment is more than welcome.

1. Clone the contents of the repo into your config folder. In my own case, at the `home/.config/ directory` :
```
git clone https://github.com/FacundoAlvarado9/nvim-config.git nvim
```

2. Open `nvim`
```
nvim
```

3. I would first upgrade `vim-plug` itself
```
:PlugUpgrade
```

4. Check status of plugins
```
:PlugStatus
```

5. Depending on the nvim's suggestion
```
:PlugClean
```
or
```
:PlugInstall
```
